## Testing

You can use the included test script to verify the server is working correctly and see example usage patterns:

```bash
python3 test_server.py
```

The test script will:
- âœ… Check server health and connectivity
- âœ… Verify model availability and status
- âœ… Test OpenAI SDK compatibility
- âœ… Run multi-turn conversations
- âœ… Test multilingual support (Chinese)
- âœ… Demonstrate streaming functionality

Make sure the server is running before executing the test script. The script provides comprehensive examples of how to interact with the API using both direct HTTP requests and the OpenAI Python SDK.

## Development Notes

ðŸ¤– This project was mainly "vibe coded" using Cursor + Claude Sonnet 4 & ChatGPT o3.

ðŸ¤– ***Broke out to Multi-Server functionality with some curiosity, gumption, lots of trial and error, and - ChatGTP 4.0/4.1/o3/o3-pro/5.0***
